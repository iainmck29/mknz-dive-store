    'The Mares Dragon SLS BCD is a high specification BCD that is built for comfort and style with an all-round bladder and rear winglets for excellent heads up surface buoyancy and equally excellent horizontal trim whilst diving.

The Dragon SLS is packed full of features that make the BCD super comfortable and convenient to use. The harness features fully padded shoulder straps with swivelling quick release buckles that anchor further back on the waist for a snugger fit as well as a depth compensating cummerbund, adjustable waist buckle and chest strap. The full height rigid backplate is covered with plenty of padded over the shoulder, spine and lumber areas.

The Dragon SLS features the new SLS integrated weight system which uses a pull to release type mechanism and a visual aid to indicate proper positioning and locking of the weight pockets. In addition to the main weight pockets the BCD is also fitted with rear trim pockets mounted beneath the rear winglets.

The BCD is also fitted with two zipped pockets that feature stretch panels for extra space, grommet holes above the left pocket for an optional Mares BCD Knife and a number of stainless steel D-rings to safely anchor your accessories.',

    'Skunka have a very loyal following when it to comes to their wetsuit range - if you fit their style then it is wise to stick with it.

The Skunka Everflex 3/2mm rear entry wetsuit is even better than their previous one, with all-new Blue Diamond Span interior for maximum warmth and an increase in stretch of about 20%.

Everflex suits benefit from another Skunka exclusive: they are built with ultra-stretch 100% X-Foam neoprene. Not only does X-Foam neoprene shed water so it can dry quickly and keep divers warmer, it is also the only neoprene formulation that complies with the very strict P.A.H. (Polycyclic AromaticHydrocarbons) test requirements. In other words, X-Foam neoprene protects divers.

No other dive suit brands on the market are made with X-Foam, which is the only neoprene formulation that not only is comfortable, flexible and durable, but also protects the environment. Everflex steamers use the Pure Design Concept to achieve shapes that mould to the body like a second skin.

This suit offers full protection from scrapes and stings, and is warm enough for us in moderate to warm waters.',
